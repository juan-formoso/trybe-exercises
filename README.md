This repository contains all the exercises I've completed while studying Software Development at Trybe and during my journey to become a successful programmer aswell.

Feel free to explore it! :)

In case of curiosity: Trybe's course features over 1,500 hours of classes covering introduction to software development, front-end, back-end, computer science, software engineering, agile methodologies and behavioral skills.
